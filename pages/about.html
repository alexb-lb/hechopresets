  My name is Dan Hecho and I'm glad to welcome you to my new website offering my Lightroom presets.
  <br>
  I have been engaged in artistic photography since 2007 and all these years Lightroom has been my favorite instrument
  for color correction. However; I was not satisfied with any of the proposed color solutions for Lightroom, so I
  created my own method of working with the program. Today my color style is recognizable all over the world. My goal
  was to create a color scheme correlating with the classical Renaissance paintings. It makes my photos look more like
  paintings than digital photography.
  <br>
  From 2010 to 2017, I gave several hundred master classes around the world, telling about my methods of shooting and
  color correction for obtaining unique images and developing one’s own style.
  <br>
  I‘ve been to almost all continents and dozens of countries in Europe, Asia, North and South America, not only showing
  my way of using Lightroom, but also acquiring some new experience of processing images.
  <br>
  <br>
  This internet resource presents my full knowledge of color correction in Lightroom obtained for the past 10 years, and
  I am honored to share it with you.
  <br>
  <br>
  Using my presets and my method of color correction of images, you come to your own style, i.e. taking my experience as
  a base you grow and create unique art works. There is no universal button like "make a masterpiece", but there are
  tools, which can be used to achieve success easily.
  <br>
  <br>
  Make your pictures personalized and express yourself freely! Reveal your unique inner world by means of your photos!
  <br>

  <strong>Now a few words about the changes on the site:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Old packages are renamed and recomposed, pricing is optimized. As usually, packages differ only in the number of presets.</li>
  <li>There is a completely new package with Pentax which was created during the last year of my work with the Pentax 645z camera (I recommend all my clients as an update for previously purchased packages).</li>
  <li>In the new Deluxe series, it is possible to get my personal feedback and training via Skype. So if you are willing to apply my presets perfectly, do not miss this chance!</li>
  <li>My full experience of working with Lightroom can be found in “Platinum Deluxe”. You get an individual online master class for color correction in Lightroom with 2 one hour long Skype sessions and the whole set of my presets (over 1300 pieces) collected during the 10 years of work.</li>
