  Good day for everybody!<br/>My name is Dan Hecho and I am glad to present you my new website, where you can see and
  purchase my exclusive presets for color correction using Adobe Lightroom.<br/><br/>These preset packages represent all
  my working experience in Adobe Lightroom with the release of the very first version 1.1!<br/>There you can see the
  presets which have been created over many years (more than eight) in the process of working on real commercial and
  art-creative shootings, as well as presets which combined experience of many master classes and workshops in different
  countries of Europe and America from 2010 to 2015.<br/><br/>The main thrust of my work is creative art photography,
  fine art. Therefore, the main part of presets devoted to non-standard color correction proceeds from my author's
  vision of the color palette, removing excess colors and leaving the two basic colors, approaching a range of classical
  painting using muted colors.<br/><br/><br/><img src="images/about/about_001.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" height="675"/> <img

  correction packages I add many presets from real wedding and family shots, there are a more natural color with a nice
  bright skin tone.<br/><br/> For those who are interested to learn how to get warm-cold colors on the photos using my
  presets, I offer to watch a short video lesson, that will help you to learn master this technique easily and achieve
  the results that are similar to mine in your work.<br/><br/><img src="images/about/about_003.jpg"
