        I purchased your Deluxe package and all I can say is wow! I really love these pre-sets, they are becoming part
        of
        my workflow. They are easy to use and make such a difference to the final image in post production. I would
        recommend these pre-sets to any photographer.

        What is about the presets, I found it really universal when editing my photos, although I am doing this only for
        my free time.

        Hecho Presets are quickly becoming my favourite and goto presets among all my collection. Dan hecho's color
        tones have a very signature touch to them that are unqiue and unlike any other preset available online for
        purchase. Hecho Special and Hecho Film are my favorite among the Gold package.
        This package truly standout as presets and i would highly recommend anyone looking for presets to purchase and
        try Hecho presets.

        Hello Dan
        <br>
        I really like your presets and trying to use them as much as possible. I especially like the presets that works
        with partial color control and I am trying to make photos that works with the presets Anis, Arh and my favorite
        Chocol.
        <br>
        I live in Sweden and it would be fantastic if you can arrange an workshop around here.

        your presets are simply awesome, they changed my style in the way I
        like and my models like, I also purchased your video lesson and I wish
        you could make another one this year, because you are both great
        photographer and great teacher

        I started using the presets from the Silverl Package, and these presets are the best! The variety and quality of
        them are outstanding. Excellent for even the most newbies editors like me. This is a perfect breakdown of how to
        efficiently edit with the fabulous Dan Hecho style. Love your work!
        <br>
        Of course, I need a lot of practice, but really love the results.
        <br>
        Thanks!!

        One word, AMAZING!!
        <br>
        I had bought many presets of other photographers but no one gave me the results I wanted...until I got the Silver Preset Pack  from Dan Hecho and wow! Now I can't stop using them!
        They really gave me the colors I wanted on My photography, they are so simple to use and they also include some photographs from Dan for you to practice and see what they can do.
        My favorites are the "Film" and the "black and white" presets.
        <br>
        On the  Film folder you can find some presets (like Film 4) that give you those cool blues and warms orange that are characteristic on Dan´s Photography.
        I really Love Them first I was kind of scared with the price but they are totally worth them.
        <br>
        I totally recommend them, and I can say is the best preset pack I had ever bought.
        <br>
        Here Are a Lot of pictures where I have use them!

        Hello Dan!
        <br>
        Purchasing your presets was one of the best choices I have made!!  The color tone is amazing & unique and there is so many variety of presets to play with. This is by far the most value for money purchase as it is not only user-friendly, the result is guaranteed! I have no regrets ever since I started using your presets.
